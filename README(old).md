Unit 09 Node.js and ES6+ Homework: Good README Generator
Create a command-line application that dynamically generates a README.md from a user's input. The application will be invoked with the following command:

node index.js
The user will be prompted for their GitHub username, which will be used to make a call to the GitHub API to retrieve their email and profile image. They will then be prompted with questions about their project.

The README will be populated with the following:

At least one badge
Project title
Description
Table of Contents
Installation
Usage
License
Contributing
Tests
Questions
User GitHub profile picture
User GitHub email
Following the common templates for user stories, we can frame this challenge as follows:

AS A developer

I WANT a README generator

SO THAT I can easily put together a good README for a new project
Refer to the Good README guide.

Business Context
When creating an open source project on GitHub, it is important to have a quality README with information about the app--what is the app for, how to use the app, how to install it, how to report issues, and how to make contributions so that other developers are more likely to use and contribute to the success of the project. A command-line application will allow for quick and easy generation of a project README to get started quickly. This will allow a project creator to spend more time working on finishing the project and less time creating a good README.

Commit Early and Often
One of the most important skills to master as a web developer is version control. Building the habit of committing via Git is important for two reasons:

Your commit history is a signal to employers that you are actively working on projects and learning new skills.

Your commit history allows you to revert your code base in the event that you need to return to a previous state.

Follow these guidelines for committing:

Make single-purpose commits for related changes to ensure a clean, manageable history. If you are fixing two issues, make two commits.

Write descriptive, meaningful commit messages so that you and anyone else looking at your repository can easily understand its history.

Don't commit half-done work, for the sake of your collaborators (and your future self!).

Test your application before you commit to ensure functionality at every step in the development process.

We would like you to have more than 200 commits by graduation, so commit early and often!
